# Alien RPG Tools

## What's this?

Generators and tools for the Alien RPG, by Free League Publishing. All content belongs to them.

* https://alien-rpg.com/
* https://frialigan.se/en/games/alien/

## Issues

* Planetary names (what does LV/MT/RF stand for?)
* Planet size, GAS GIANT MOON: â€“4 (I thought only terrestrial and ice planets could be colonised?)
* No atmosphere = Desert World (Atmosphere table doesn't have a "no atmo" option, only "special"?)

## TODO

### Sooner

* [ ] Full star system generation (i.e. the MVP)
* [ ] Contract Fria Ligan for permission to use content for the generator
* [ ] Add temperature range field, put in output

### Later

* [ ] Html interface with... Svelte?
* [ ] CSS via https://newcss.net/theme/terminal/
* [ ] Host on https://scott.maclure.info/alienrpg
* [ ] Unit test JS modules via https://github.com/avajs/ava
* [ ] Add Job Generator as another button
* [ ] Save/local state via localStorage
* [ ] Generate uninhabited planetary details for the rest of the system
